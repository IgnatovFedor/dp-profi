1038,47,agent_1,"It's interesting how sometimes Americans joke about moving to Canada due to our politics, yet sometimes Canada's politics make just as much sense as ours",
1039,47,agent_2,"Canada has many politics, but probably not as many as the US. The US has too many politics. What is climate change anyhow?",
1040,47,agent_1,"Climate change is the more updated term for what used to be called ""global warming."" Canada is starting to put policies into place that they believe will help with the said issue, but most aren't sure why, it seems",
1041,47,agent_2,"I guess it's tricky. I would like to see some progress, but people seem reluctant to change. Plus, will it raise taxes?",
1042,47,agent_1,"It raises tax on anything that produces carbon, in most cases. Which includes gas, of course",
1043,47,agent_2,"In 1975 the Soviet Union successfully sent a spacecraft to Venus, and captured the first images from the surface of another planet. Did the colonists survive? Is there a secret base on Venus? Do they have to worry about climate change there? Maybe we should communicate with them about carbon taxes.",
1044,47,agent_1,"I'm not sure, because Venus doesn't experience seasons due to the lack of tilt in the axis. It also rotates clockwise, which might affect some things. I think seasons are what make people paranoid about climate change",
1045,47,agent_2,"Maybe we should outlaw seasons. Canadia has a prime minister, right? Could we talk to the PM?",
1046,47,agent_1,"I think so. It's a strange setup. Seasons aren't something that can be outlawed, but rather something that occurs naturally. I can't imagine what it would be like living on Uranus. It actually rotates sideways and looks like it's spinning compared to other planets",
1047,47,agent_2,"I just found out that the Canadian PM serves at her majesty's pleasure, so the post does not have a fixed term. In a survey, 51% thought the prime minister was directly elected by Canadians. I wonder if the Queen has ever ejected a prime minister from the game of thrones. Can the Queen do something about seasons and climate change? She might be busy though.",
1048,47,agent_1,"It is a strange position, indeed. The Queen is old enough to know whether our current weather is actually a problem that needs to be addressed or rather a natural cycle, right? I wonder if the same applies to the PM of Australia. Technically, the position isn't even in their constitution, but they were owned by England",
1049,47,agent_2,"I dream of moving to Uranus to get away from these sorts of politics here. But the Internet connection is probably slow. Plus climate change would follow me there, I suppose.  Does Australia have climate? Do they have Internet?",
1050,47,agent_1,"Everywhere has a climate of some sort, but some are milder than others. And of course Australia has the internet. If you move to Japan instead, you'll get a silver cup from the PM there if you make to 100",
1051,47,agent_2,"Is there a connection between climate change and Internet? The Chinese government has censored the word 'censorship.' Could they censor ""Climate change"" well and be done with that? Could the Japanese invent a clever device to make climate change less expensive or faster?",
1052,47,agent_1,"None of these governments can actually control the weather. Well, they do try. Like how the Norwegian government donated money to help save the rainforest in the Amazon. But that's less climate change and more man using natural resources",
1053,47,agent_2,"The Norwegians probably bought a bunch of snow and shipped it down to the rainforest to cool things off. Thoughtful, but ultimately futile.",
1054,47,agent_1,"They don't have to buy snow. They could just ship the snow they already get. I wonder if it's actually possible to buy the Eiffel Tower. There was a man who managed to sell it twice by impersonating a government official, but it may not even be a good investment",
1055,47,agent_2,The Eiffel Tower is romantic but does not have enough parking. Did you know that Andrew Bonar Law is the only person from outside the UK to ever become the prime minister of the UK? Why did his parents saddle him with such an awkward middle name?,
1056,47,agent_1,"Maybe it's French? Of course the British wouldn't make it a requirement to be born there, unlike Americans. You can't be President unless you were born on US soil",
1057,47,agent_2,What if you were born on the moon? That would be unfair. What if the moon were right over the US at the moment of your birth?,
1058,47,agent_1,"What if you were born on Jupiter's moon Ganymede? It's not technically a planet, but it's big enough to be if it decides to orbit around the sun instead. Oh, the things we may never know",
1059,48,agent_1,Do you like to read? Im looking for a great book for my son,
1060,48,agent_2,I do like to read.  Ive always been a big fan of the Harry Potter series.  I hear Matt James has some good books too.,
1061,48,agent_1,"I agree, Matt James books are pretty good, I had my child eead the book The Funeral, it was a great book, he enjoyed it",
1062,48,agent_2,That's good.  I always look for something new to read.,
1063,48,agent_1,"Yeah, you should try it out if you have a son or a niece, nephew, its a book ages 5 to 8 so not the best book for an adult",
1064,48,agent_2,"I dont have any kids myself, but I do have tons of friends who have kids in that age range.  Ill suggest it to them.  How much do you know about cars?",
1065,48,agent_1,"I know the first model for mas production was the Ford T Model, it was produced back in the year 1908",
1066,48,agent_2,"It is amazing how far cars have come,  it is even legal to put flamethrowers on your car in south Africa to prevent car jackings.",
1067,48,agent_1,"Wow, that would make burglars think twice about stealing a car, McDonalds created the drive through back in 1975",
1068,48,agent_2,I heard it was because soliders couldnt get out of their cars in fatigues.,
1069,48,agent_1,"Yeah it was a service intended for soldiers first, it sure is a great invention, has saved me a couple of times,",
1070,48,agent_2,Same here.  But Im no professional driver like Jann Mardenborough just because I played Gran Turismo.  No drive thrus in that game,
1071,48,agent_1,"Crazy how he picked up his skills by playing Gran Turismo I heard he beat more than 90,000 people",
1072,48,agent_2,Thats crazy.  Must have been a lot of hours logged in the game.  Did you know there are more possible moves in chess than atoms in the universe.,
1073,48,agent_1,"I guess thats why chess is one of the most challenging games/sport out there, do you like to play chess, know how to play it?",
1074,48,agent_2,"I have played before, but I am certainly no Bobby fisher",
1075,48,agent_1,Who is Bobby Fisher? is he a chess player,
1076,48,agent_2,He was.  There was a movie made about him.,
1077,48,agent_1,"I havent seen that one maybe I will check if its on Netflix, you know the president of the chess federation thinks the game was invented by aliens!!",
1078,48,agent_2,Really?  That is kinda of crazy.  The rules are a bit complicated.,
1079,48,agent_1,"They are and also the fact you told me early about more moves than atoms, it does seem like a game invented by a more advance civilization than ours",
1080,48,agent_2,Awesome.. Great Chat!,
1081,49,agent_1,"Hello there, do you attend many concerts?",
1082,49,agent_2,"I try to when I can, how about you?",
1083,49,agent_1,"Yeah same here, I would like to go a lot more, but just don't have the time or my work schedule conflicts.",
1084,49,agent_2,"If it were 2001, you would have been able to probably get to at least one linkin park concert since they put on 324 of them!",
1085,49,agent_1,"That is such an insane touring schedule for one year, wow.",
1086,49,agent_2,Oh I agree! That's not even close to the Ramones though!,
1087,49,agent_1,"Yeah I think they have played over 2,000 shows!",
1088,49,agent_2,That is basically a non stop tour for 20 years! Have you ever seen a Creed concert?,
1089,49,agent_1,"Yeah that is, crazy.  And no I haven't, have you?",
1090,49,agent_2,"I never plan on it, especially since they were sued for playing a concert so badly in 2002 lol.",
1091,49,agent_1,"That is just funny, people sue others for just about anything.  What happened to live and learn?  Like you don't like it, so don't buy a ticket and go next time.",
1092,49,agent_2,I couldn't have said it any better! Did you know bruce lee used to be a dancer?,
1093,49,agent_1,"I think I have heard that about him, it makes sense though, he really could more around effortlessly.",
1094,49,agent_2,He was the jack of all trades! He even won the hong kong cha-cha championship in 1958.,
1095,49,agent_1,That is hilarious!  I wish there was a Youtube video of that performance.,
1096,49,agent_2,"That would have been nice to see, and also seeing Tupac do ballet in high school!",
1097,49,agent_1,"Yeah that too, I would have liked to seen Tupac doing ballet so funny!",
1098,49,agent_2,"Music has come a long way for sure, especially from the classical form back in the 1500's.",
1099,49,agent_1,"Yeah it sure has, but the skill level back then was incredible!  I find classic paintings just amazing as well.",
1100,49,agent_2,"That is an outstanding period of time! I like how in 2011, a computer wrote a classical piece!",
1101,49,agent_1,"That is very cool, very interesting as well.  It's been nice talking with you as well, I hope you have a good night!",
1102,50,agent_1,Good evening!  Are you an NBA fan?,
1103,50,agent_2,I try to watch the finals. especially if golden state is in them. You?,
1104,50,agent_1,"I followed it more in the past, but keep an eye on it.  I was definitely following when Jordan played.  Crazy to think when Air Jordan's were first worn, Michael got a fine every game.",
1105,50,agent_2,"Yes, but nike didnt care. it was cheap publicity, drawing attention to their biggest star. the NBA should have tripled the fine.",
1106,50,agent_1,LOL!  I wish I had a great shoe deal.  Allen Iverson was getting like $800 K a year even after retiring and will be getting a lump sum $32 M payment when he is 55.,
1107,50,agent_2,He just has to live to age 55 and then he has enough money to start his own shoe company. LOL,
1108,50,agent_1,Then maybe advise him as a president not sign a similar deal for a player unless it's been as good for Reebok.  It's going to be a one-and-done type player though.  The days of players like Duncan staying four years and then going on to be good pros are probably over.,
1109,50,agent_2,"Yeah, there is too much money at stake. a career ending injury in college would be tough for someone like lebron.",
1110,50,agent_1,"I wonder if there is a safer way to play and still be effective.  I bet it would be hard to curb the desire to be flashy.  Apparently shooting a granny style free throw is scientifically proven to be the best method, but most refuse to do it.",
1111,50,agent_2,"It does look goofy, but rick barry did it and he shot 90% or more from the line. Shaq should probably have done it.",
1112,50,agent_1,He would have surely started a trend and maybe hack-a-Shaq stops altogether?  Shaq was definitely dominant.  Maybe not as much so as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was in college as he managed to be so good at using the dunk it got banned for like a decade.,
1113,50,agent_2,"Kareem was great, but the league should have changed something else. maybe the size of the key? the dunk is a shot that the fans love.",
1114,50,agent_1,"That might have been something.  Sometimes the powers that be just don't understand the trends.  Even the inventor, Naismith, wasn't necessarily the master and is historically the only losing coach in the history of Kansas!",
1115,50,agent_2,"Yeah, great at inventing games, not so good at coaching. LOL",
1116,50,agent_1,LOL.  I wonder how much he got paid.  Today's college coaches tend to be the highest state employee through the majority of the country.  Must be nice.,
1117,50,agent_2,I think that the college system has its priorities upside down. i wish that more money went to education and that tuition wasnt so high.,
1118,50,agent_1,"If they can figure out how to get 3g cell service way up at the top of Mt. Everest, surely they could figure out a better system to use with college!",
1119,50,agent_2,"Yeah,i think that they use satellites for everest. I wish that the US devoted a bit more to training engineers and less to athletics.",
1120,50,agent_1,"I think if kids can see it as fun, it will go along way.  At least find a way to get them away from clicking away at the internet all day, which can actually be addictive.",
1121,50,agent_2,"Yeah, i figure that i am addicted at this point. Oh well. Anyway, great chat!",
1122,50,agent_1,"You too!  Have a great evening,",
1123,51,agent_1,What do you think of Lebron James?,
1124,51,agent_2,Hi there are you a fan of the NBA?,
1125,51,agent_1,"Don't get to watch much, you? It's composed of 30 teams right?",
1126,51,agent_2,Something weird happened there.  I don't mind LeBron James.  I'm originally from Ohio so I have a soft spot for him.  lol,
1127,51,agent_1,"Well i won't hold it against you, you gotta represent. They say playing with him is a gift and a curse.",
1128,51,agent_2,"True.  I'm reading that some of his high school basketball games would attract 1,750 fans and the tickets cost anywhere from $100 to $120.  That's true.  I remember the hype when he was in high school. I always thought then that he was over rated.  I was wrong!  lol",
1129,51,agent_1,"Well we will have to agree to disagree on that one. He's is talented but his character needs improvement in my opinion as not to offend, lol.",
1130,51,agent_2,"No biggie.  lol  I have too many problems of my own to waste time worrying about LeBron.  lol  Maybe Judge Judy will knock him off the top of being the highest paid celebrity.  Currently she makes $123,000 per episode making her the highest paid celebrity after LeBron.",
1131,51,agent_1,Wow good for her she is hardcore and funny as all get out!! You know Allen Iverson signed a lifetime contract with Reebok?,
1132,51,agent_2,I've heard of it.  Didn't he get big money?,
1133,51,agent_1,Yeah i think it was kind of smart on his part. He gets paid 800K a year until age 55 and then he gets 32M.,
1134,51,agent_2,"Nice.  I couldn't even imagine to be what that would be like.  The New Zealand basketball team are nicknamed the ""tall blacks""  Yikes.  What are they thinking?",
1135,51,agent_1,"Right, Wow! Did you know that in 39 out of 50 states the highest paid state employees are college football or basketball coaches.",
1136,51,agent_2,I wonder how the tax payers feel in those states or if they even know that fact?  lol,
1137,51,agent_1,Yeah i'm sure there's a lot of kickbacks. Do you know where the highest basketball court in the land is?,
1138,51,agent_2,That I've heard about.  That's on the top floor of the US Supreme Court building!  Do you remember Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?,
1139,51,agent_1,That's right i thought the pun was pretty cool. The master jammer of course he's a legend.,
1140,51,agent_2,"Yes!  I have one more trivia ""who is"" question.  Ever heard of James Naismith?",
1141,51,agent_1,I'm going to take a guess and say he was a basketball player earlier on in the invention of the game.,
1142,51,agent_2,Yep!  He also was the only losing coach in the history of the University of Kansas!,
1143,51,agent_1,Wow that sucks but at least he left us a legacy that is still thriving. Very nice chatting with you!,
1144,51,agent_2,The irony of it!  ...yes I agree with you.  It was nice chatting with you as well!,
1145,51,agent_1,Have a good day!,
1146,52,agent_1,"Hi there , looking forward to chat with You !",
1147,52,agent_2,Hello! What did you think about the article?,
1148,52,agent_1,"It's blue ;) no I'm kidding, here we go ! Did You know Reggie miller, nba hall of famer, couldn't escape his older sister cheryl's shadow while in high school. on january 26, 1982, he scored a career high 40 points. he tried bragging about it on the car ride home, only to find out cheryl scored 105 points and broken 8 national records!?",
1149,52,agent_2,I couldn't believe that Coach Stan Van Gundy was fined for saying that the NBA shouldn't be playing games on Christmas Day.,
1150,52,agent_1,"Yeah, that's kind of weird... they fined him just for saying that ? It's just his opinion... what happened to the freedom of speech ?",
1151,52,agent_2,I find it unusual that so much attention is paid to Jayson Tatum's hairline. Wouldn't you think that they should focus on his basketball skills?,
1152,52,agent_1,"I mean sure... but, what are they focusing instead ?",
1153,52,agent_2,"They are discussing his hairline, which is apparently famous and meticulously crafted by his barber.",
1154,52,agent_1,why the heck wants to read about that... half of those players  are bold anyway ;) lol,
1155,52,agent_2,Exactly. I also wonder why there is only 1 Candian team in the NBA. Is the sport just not popular in Canada?,
1156,52,agent_1,I'm pretty sure it's popular but maybe not basketball... they got hockey ! ;),
1157,52,agent_2,True. I read that Space Jam is the highest-grossing basketball movie of all time. But I can't think of any other basketball movies!,
1158,52,agent_1,"Space Jam ;) lol, I loved that movie... Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan rock ! :)",
1159,52,agent_2,It was a fun mix of live action and animation.,
1160,52,agent_1,Yes ! and so many celebrities ! Real and from cartoons ;) lol,
1161,52,agent_2,I find it hard to believe that Shaq has only 1 recorded 3 point score in his career.,
1162,52,agent_1,no way ! Really ? That can't be true...,
1163,52,agent_2,"That's what my source materials says. Though it seems like it is from Wikipedia, so that could have been edited wrong.",
1164,52,agent_1,I'm emailing Shaq right now... lol ;),
1165,52,agent_2,The article also says that LeBron is regarded by some as the greatest player of all time. I'm sure that could be a lively debate among fans.,
1166,52,agent_1,of I'm sure... there is so many great players that I don't think one can say something like that about any one of them...,
1167,52,agent_2,Thanks for chatting with me!,
1168,52,agent_1,It was a pleasure !,
1169,53,agent_1,"Hi, how are you?",
1170,53,agent_2,"I'm doing well, you?",
1171,53,agent_1,"Very well, thanks. Did you know The Nintendo entertainment system could display only 54 colors.",
1172,53,agent_2,I think it was called Nintendo 54 at one point. That must be why. It was discontinued in Japan in 2003.,
1173,53,agent_1,"really! Nice...Bill nye ""the science guy"" got his break in entertainment by winning a steve martin lookalike contest.",
1174,53,agent_2,"He does look like him! Ronald Reagan got rejected for a movie because they didn't think he had a ""presidential look""",
1175,53,agent_1,"The arrow through the head gave it away... Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste and only later adopted by polo players",
1176,53,agent_2,"That's pretty cool. Speaking of tennis, only one man has ever won the US Open. That was in 1968.",
1177,53,agent_1,I did not know that. Im going to have to look into that. They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open,
1178,53,agent_2,That was a great idea! The longest tennis match lasted 11 hours.,
1179,53,agent_1,"I would need a nap! Us open quarterfinalist gael monfils beat the ""roger federer of paddle tennis"" after learning how to play just days earlier",
1180,53,agent_2,Wow. Roger federer has been gifted two cows over his career for winning the 2003 wimbledon and the 2013 swiss open.,
1181,53,agent_1,What the hell do you do with a cow?,
1182,53,agent_2,Seriously! I wonder who gave them to him? Super weird!,
1183,53,agent_1,"Us open quarterfinalist gael monfils beat the ""roger federer of paddle tennis"" after learning how to play just days earlier",
1184,53,agent_2,Roger federer is the first living person in switzerland to be honored with an official stamp.,
1185,53,agent_1,"I would love a stamp with me on it! In 2016, roger federer suffered the biggest injury of his career when he stretched too far while drawing a bath for his daughters and tore a meniscus.",
1186,53,agent_2,Haha. Figures! He has won 20 Grand Slam singles titles.,
1187,53,agent_1,That's a lot. Only 20 more than me...,
1188,53,agent_2,Ain't that the truth! He was in the top ten from 2002-2016 and then again in 2017.,
1189,53,agent_1,Nice chatting with you.,
1190,54,agent_1,"hey there, how is it going?",
1191,54,agent_2,"hey I'm good, did you know that the movie ET was originally going to be a horror movie?",
1192,54,agent_1,"I cannot imagine that, maybe because I have such fond memories of it. Strange to think that the king of horror movies thought Bambi was a horror movie.",
1193,54,agent_2,"ya I heard of that with Stephen King, do you have an android or iphone btw?",
1194,54,agent_1,I have an Android. How about you?,
1195,54,agent_2,"ya I also have an android, personally I don't like iphones, did you know that an iphone 8 actually costs only like $300 to makes",
1196,54,agent_1,"Wow, and they are sold for so much more. Apparently women are more likely to have an iphone than man.",
1197,54,agent_2,"ah that makes sense, I think it's crazy that more than 2.2 million apps exist in the app store",
1198,54,agent_1,"That is crazy, no wonder people say there is an app for that and for this. Matt bellamy actually used his iphone to record the heartbeat of his unborn son and used it in his song Follow me",
1199,54,agent_2,"wow that is cool, what kind of music does Matt Bellamy make do you know?",
1200,54,agent_1,"Rock, he is a member of the band Muse. The first iphone though, Steve Jobs has so much trouble with the ram of the phone and it would crash during the first presentation.",
1201,54,agent_2,"wow that is funny, I'm glad he invented the iphone though, I remember when George Hotz unlocked the original iphone, I think they sued him didn't they",
1202,54,agent_1,"Oh I did not know that, wow. And Microsoft on the other hand held a funeral to mark the death of the iphone when they launched their own phones.",
1203,54,agent_2,"haha I like that that's funny, did you know that there is no correlation between the bars of service and the actual cell phone connection quality?",
1204,54,agent_1,Did not know that. So much interesting stuff out there.,
1205,54,agent_2,what is your favorite kind of animal? I like dolphins personally,
1206,54,agent_1,Oh I do not know if I can pick just one. I like horses a lot though.,
1207,54,agent_2,ya and apparently dolphins can communicate with other dolphins over the phone and know who they are talking to,
1208,54,agent_1,"Hmmm have not heard anything about that. Speaking of sounds, do you have a preferred ringtone?",
1209,54,agent_2,"I do not, I just use the default ones on my android phone actually what about you?",
1210,54,agent_1,"Me either, but apparently phone companies pay a lot of attention to the ringtones that they offer to us to ensure they get our attention.",
1211,54,agent_2,"ya I guess there is a luxury phone maker that uses the london symphony orchestra for their ringtones, I wonder what those sound like",
1212,54,agent_1,"I do not know. That must cost a lot of money. Nice chatting with you, have a good one.",
1213,54,agent_2,have a great day and make sure to watch the exorcist! no one in the cast thought it was going to be a horror movie when they were making it haha,
1214,54,agent_1,"oh cool, thanks.",
1215,55,agent_1,Is your toilet clean?,
1216,55,agent_2,"What a way to start a conversation, lol! I guess it should be for world toilet day.",
1217,55,agent_1,Hahahaaaa... i thought you would appreciate it!  Do you watch south park?,
1218,55,agent_2,"I do not but obviously ever one is aware of it, my wife loves it.",
1219,55,agent_1,"Well, tell your wife good job!  LOL They sent the simpsons flowers when family guy had it's final episode.",
1220,55,agent_2,Yeah i read that. Speaking of the Simpsons Bart was never in or mentioned in one episode.,
1221,55,agent_1,That's crazy....i watch the simpsons and cant place which episode that is?,
1222,55,agent_2,Pokemon on the other hand has had over 750 episodes in 16 years.,
1223,55,agent_1,That's crazy!  I wonder how they have the time to produce so many?  Did you know that George Carlin was the longest running voice for thomas the tank?,
1224,55,agent_2,I did but i heard he shared that spot light with a couple other performers. one being Ringo Star and the other Alec Baldwin.,
1225,55,agent_1,"Yeah, that's true... but they were very short time periods for them.",
1226,55,agent_2,Oh ok. You know Jupiter's storms are so powerful that they can be picked up on AM radio.,
1227,55,agent_1,REally?  I want to listen now!  I wonder what it sounds like?,
1228,55,agent_2,Me too! There is also a website that you can listen to 1000's of episodes of classical radio dramas for free.,
1229,55,agent_1,Ooooo... i love those things!  They are soooo amzing.  You ever heard any of them?,
1230,55,agent_2,"A classic radio Drama for free, can't say that i have.lol",
1231,55,agent_1,They are really cool... it's like old stuff like the green lantern and mysteries.,
1232,55,agent_2,"I remember the Shadow. Do you know that one? It became a movie played by Alex Baldwin. ""The Shadow Knows""",
1233,55,agent_1,Yessssss!  See.. you do know!!  LOL  You should try making a radio out of a pencil and razorblade :),
1234,55,agent_2,Knowing me i would probably cut myself. I hear that's what soldiers did in WW2. Catch name was Foxhole Radios.,
1235,55,agent_1,Great chat... enjoy your day!,
1236,56,agent_1,hey do you ever watch NBA games?,
1237,56,agent_2,"I have I love watching NBA games, do you?",
1238,56,agent_1,"ya I do like watching them, theyd be a lot more boring without the dunk though, did you hear that they tried to ban that?",
1239,56,agent_2,"No, what happened? did they actually ban the dunk shot?",
1240,56,agent_1,"ya they did, kareem abdul-jabbar was too good with it so they banned it for a decade",
1241,56,agent_2,"That seems unfair not only to the game but to the crown if the kid know how to dunk shot then let him, its not his fault his talented",
1242,56,agent_1,"nope its not his fault he's too good haha, did you hear about ""the highest court in the land""?",
1243,56,agent_2,"No, where is that court located?",
1244,56,agent_1,"well its on the top floor of the supreme court actually, do you think they ever actually play basketball up there? They're so old haha",
1245,56,agent_2,"I think they do, judges againsts judges, who rules in a game like that one lol",
1246,56,agent_1,"haha ya maybe they settle court cases up there, I just don't know haha",
1247,56,agent_2,"Yeah, interesting way to break a tie, do you know who Reggie Miller is?",
1248,56,agent_1,"I've heard of him, wasn't his sister really good at basketball?",
1249,56,agent_2,"Yeah he was a hall of famer but his sister was twice as good, I guess she is in the hall of fame as well, she did break 8 records",
1250,56,agent_1,"that is impressive, I want to try wearing Air Jordans, do you think they actually help you play better?",
1251,56,agent_2,"Im nor sure, I think they got banned for a reason so they might give the player a competitive advantage, those are really comfortable shoes though",
1252,56,agent_1,"ya and Nike Just paid the fee so Jordan could keep using them, crazy!",
1253,56,agent_2,"I guess Nike has the money to pay a fine for every game, did you know that granny style is the best way to take a shot",
1254,56,agent_1,yes I think more players should do it! It was literally scientifically proven to be the best,
1255,56,agent_2,"Yeah but they think it looks stupid so I guess we wont be seeing that soon, it would be funny though",
1256,56,agent_1,"I kind of admire Tim Duncan, he stayed in college to get his degree instead of going right to the NBA",
1257,56,agent_2,"Yeah thats a hard thing to do for sure, many would prefer the money, its a good thing he decided to end college",
1258,56,agent_1,"oh for sure, do you ever listen to the radio?",
1259,57,agent_1,Hey!,
1260,57,agent_2,How are you today?,
1261,57,agent_1,"I am fantastic! And you? Also I find it interesting how many people are seeking asylum in the USA, pretty interesting....and sad.",
1262,57,agent_2,"Doing well, thank you for asking!! I agree and cannot fathom the conditions they must endure even if temporary. I do agree it is very sad.",
1263,57,agent_1,"I was reading about how the government is trying to process so many, I feel that it is nice to know Mexico is helping these migrants with a shower and food when they get to the border and even fresh clothes. They can stay in tents. I can't imagine.",
1264,57,agent_2,"I too have read something of similar depiction but read migrants had been taking baths, brushing their teeth and washing their clothes in a muddy courtyard in El Barretal.",
1265,57,agent_1,"Oh dear. I read about that, I suppose just attempting to bathe is a luxury for them. Some of those people are there for months sometimes. I wish I was wealthy I would make shelters for people in and out of America.",
1266,57,agent_2,"I agree totally for those well off to take a hand in helping those that are not. Just the basics of clothing, I mean even; dating back to the pilgrims were full of color and only wore black for very special occasions if simple shirts could be passed on clean and ready to wear if would help.",
1267,57,agent_1,"I agree, I think if people in general, American or not American could just care, we have no idea how good we have it here in the US. I suppose the Government will do what it needs to do. I agree about the clothing for sure.",
1268,57,agent_2,"Exactly !! We as people need to care more; I totally agree with you. Even if just a simple gesture from retail stores; for example , in Alabama there is a store that sells just clothes and such found in unclaimed baggage areas, why not donate a few days worth; surely it would help more than hurt.",
1269,57,agent_1,"I so agree! Those gestures could change peoples lives. And if the store wants to continue its business they could sell as they do but donate money or donate clothes.And think about it, like you said, Retail clothing stores could donate a few bucks a day and they would never miss it. Like when Apple had their clothing line in the 80s, they could have donated so much, they are such a huge company.",
1270,57,agent_2,I again agree! The common thing here though is getting those bigger companies such as Apple and Rip Curl to help. More often than not it is those that themselves are having a hard time making it from payday to payday send what they have left while the rich get richer; sadly.,
1271,57,agent_1,"Exactly! These people bed down on soggy wet blankets in muddy areas for months and people who make billions a year could change so much. Hopefully the President and Government will do what they can, but won't hold my breath lol. I read about a man who impersonated a government official in France and sold the Eiffel tower...twice....How does that happen!",
1272,57,agent_2,"lol, I too love a good deal and found many while over there but the best was experiencing the food!! Oh my goodness; the danishes pastries and cheese's were so good, nothing like we have here.",
1273,57,agent_1,"Oh wow, I would love to see the Eiffel tower. I bet they have some great clothing in France as well, I bet you can get anything tailored there.",
1274,57,agent_2,"Yes, yes they do have wonderful clothing there. Lots of people have tailored clothing over there. The culture is very different from here to there. A much bigger appreciation of and for any works of art.",
1275,57,agent_1,I bet it is amazing. It is on my bucket list lol. Is the Government there a lot like in the US?  I hope they have a great president.,
1276,57,agent_2,"Many things are similar but not quite the same, I would suggest you research many aspects before you go! For example, I read about ring ladies; they are one's that will roll a gold looking ring toward you and they try to ""sell"" what they found to you. I laughed until I seen it with my own eyes over there as well as seen many many signs to be aware of pick pockets.",
1277,57,agent_1,"Oh no, lol....I will definitely do my research! I am a sucker for buying stuff when people are selling anything from clothing to jewelry lol...I was in Mexico a few years back and bought so much from street vendors it was ridiculous, I had to stop....",
1278,57,agent_2,"lol, I too love a good deal and found many while over there but the best was experiencing the food!! Oh my goodness; the danishes pastries and cheese's were so good, nothing like we have here.",
1279,57,agent_1,"It sounds amazing! I love food, so I cannot wait to actually be there. I wonder if politics is huge over there compared to the US. Hopefully it is calm.",
1280,57,agent_2,"We found it to be very calm with regards to politics! Unlike there, here did you know that the presidents guest house is actually larger that the white house itself?",
1281,57,agent_1,Good! I am happy to hear that. Really?? I wonder why the guest house needs to be that big! Maybe it was built back when one of the 3 wealthiest presidents were in office! It has been great chatting! Have a great day!,
1282,57,agent_2,"I would say that is very possible indeed! The three richest presidents of all time were JFK, Washington as well as Jefferson. I will have to research more in it's exact date of being built.  And you have a great day as well!!",
1283,57,agent_1,Bye!,
1284,58,agent_1,"hi, do you like to watch movies?",
1285,58,agent_2,I sure do. I recently have gotten into horror,
1286,58,agent_1,"oh I see, do you like them?",
1287,58,agent_2,It is usually a hit or miss. Sometimes the horror is so bad it is funny or it is just so well executed.,
1288,58,agent_1,Yeah I guess that happens as well. do you know how they make those creepy noises?,
1289,58,agent_2,I recently learned it is called a waterphone. It is like a giant tuning fork going in a circle,
1290,58,agent_1,that is horrifying the sound it makes,
1291,58,agent_2,It is indeed eerie. It definitely does a good job setting the overall mood of the scene. The Scream which was originally supposed to be called scary movie did a good job with that,
1292,58,agent_1,"I guess there is an upside to watching horror movies, they burn more calories",
1293,58,agent_2,Maybe that will become the new fad diet?  Do you like realistic horror or when they include fantasy and the supernatural?,
1294,58,agent_1,"well, I do not watch horror movies really so not sure what to think of that. I hear the shining was scary though",
1295,58,agent_2,"I prefer comedy but sometimes I can find comedy in horror movies. Besides horror can be subjective. In the exorcist, not a single member of the cast or filming crew thought it was a horror film",
1296,58,agent_1,how did they not notice. and I heard danny from the shining did not know he was in a scary movie for years,
1297,58,agent_2,I guess that is because some actors don't watch their own productions. Did you know the voice actor for jarvus in the marvel movies still haven't watched the same movies?,
1298,58,agent_1,"did not know that. on a happier note, do you go to concerts?",
1299,58,agent_2,"Sometimes if I really like the artists and it is close enough, but usually it is too much of a hassle to go to.",
1300,58,agent_1,"yeah that is true. creed had a concert once, it was so bad, people sued them",
1301,58,agent_2,I wonder if it was the terrible planning and accommodation or the music and band?,
1302,58,agent_1,I am not sure actually. the ramones on the other hand toured for 20 years,
1303,58,agent_2,"To do it for so long, he must have gotten something right. I like concerts, but I don't want the sound to be too overwhelming and loud. Like I would not have liked to be at the deep purple concert which was the loudest in history",
1304,58,agent_1,yeah me either on that one. nice chat,
1305,59,agent_1,do you like football,
1306,59,agent_2,I do. SNoop Dog once made a song for hi son's school team,
1307,59,agent_1,Nice. Did you know U of Iowa visitor locker room is pink?,
1308,59,agent_2,"Wow that is strange, is there a reason they did that?",
1309,59,agent_1,I have no idea. Bowlers also made more than football players in the 60s,
1310,59,agent_2,Wow that is huge. Coaches are some of the highest paid employees,
1311,59,agent_1,Yeah I guess. Do you know the highest score in college football?,
1312,59,agent_2,I have no idea but do you know Texas has a huge stadium for 18000 people?,
1313,59,agent_1,"WOw , the score was 222-0, Georgia Tech beat Cumberland in 1916",
1314,59,agent_2,"Wow, the stadium cost $60 million to build",
1315,59,agent_1,Wow that is amazing. ESPN won an Emmy for the superimposed yellow line,
1316,59,agent_2,Nice. DO you like baseball?,
1317,59,agent_1,I love it. DO you know why the managers wear uniforms?,
1318,59,agent_2,"I did not know they do that, why?",
1319,59,agent_1,Because they can play if the team needs them to,
1320,59,agent_2,Wow cool. Do you know how many balls are used in a MLB season?,
1321,59,agent_1,I have no idea. DO you know who used to do their schedule for a long time?,
1322,59,agent_2,They use 160 000 balls and I have no idea who did that,
1323,59,agent_1,It was a couple who did it for 24 years,
1324,59,agent_2,Wow amazing. Did y know the CUbs won back to back world series?,
1325,59,agent_1,WOw that is amazing. Nice chatting with you.,
1326,60,agent_1,The New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles have the best chance of winning the super bowl,
1327,60,agent_2,Yes they both have a 4 to 1 odds of winning. But we shall see who gets to the Super bowl.,
1328,60,agent_1,"New England has better odds at 26%, and the Eagles starting quarterback suffered a knee injury which puts him out for the season.",
1329,60,agent_2,I am a Pats fan but Tom Brady is getting old. His passer rating is 81.6 and is his lowest in 6 years.,
1330,60,agent_1,"The Jaguars might have a chance, with Calais Campbell",
1331,60,agent_2,Yes they have really turned around from last season. They only had 3 wins last year.,
1332,60,agent_1,"The Falcons were ranked 7th in the 2017 season, and only the Patriots and the Saints had more yards gained per offensive drive.",
1333,60,agent_2,Did you know that the puts tracking chips in players shoulder pads to track their movement on the field.,
1334,60,agent_1,"No, I didn't know that. Did you know that the quarterback touches the ball on almost every offensive play?",
1335,60,agent_2,Yes except for special teams or some tricky plays.,
1336,60,agent_1,"This seems kind of unrelated, but did you know that New Orleans Saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat at the same restaurant as any NFL players? They are even required to leave the restaurant if a NFL player comes in!",
1337,60,agent_2,"That's weird, I did not know that. It seems old fashioned.I like random facts, did you know that Kellan Moore is the only lefty quarter back.",
1338,60,agent_1,Here is another random fact: the Buffalo Bills have the same amount of super bowl losses as the New England Patriots.,
1339,60,agent_2,Did you know that Russell Wilson still has a current MLB contract and hasn't played since 2011.,
1340,60,agent_1,"Did you know that the circular huddle that is used all the time in football today was created by Paul D. Hubbard, who was deaf, so that the other team wouldn't be able to see his hand signals to his teammates.",
1341,60,agent_2,"No I did not know that, that is really interesting. Back to Russell Wilson he is one of the two only African-Americans quarterbacks that have won the Super bowl.",
1342,60,agent_1,Did you know that women aren't actually not allowed to play in the NFL? There is actually no rule against them playing! They would be allowed in if they could meet the league's pretty difficult eligibility requirements.,
1343,60,agent_2,"Interesting maybe someday. Did you know that the super bowl winning quarterback Brad Johnson, threw a touchdown pass to himself. And he is the only one to do so. I wonder how that play looked.",
1344,60,agent_1,"That would be interesting to watch! Back to the super bowl. It seems like the Patriots have the best chance of winning it, yet again, despite Tom Brady's average going down.",
1345,60,agent_2,"Yay go Patriots!!!! I really hope they win, and wonder if he will retire if they do. I would if I were him. He has had a good run and I would want to go out on a good note! Besides kickers he is one of the oldest players in the game.",
1346,60,agent_1,I completely agree! Tom Brady should go out on a good note winning the Super Bowl!,
1347,61,agent_1,"Hello, have you been to the Museum of Natural History before?",
1348,61,agent_2,No I haven't but I would like to go one day.  Have you been?,
1349,61,agent_1,"I have and I can say its one of the best experiences Ive had, you should really go there sometimes",
1350,61,agent_2,I've never been to Washington but I have heard they have some great coffee shops there too.,
1351,61,agent_1,"Yeah there is Starbucks and also a Port City Java, also many coffee shops around the area",
1352,61,agent_2,I bet a lot of politicians can be seen at those.  Going there could be a tourist event too.,
1353,61,agent_1,"I bet they do, its a nice place they must also go to that Thai restaurant in Takoma Park",
1354,61,agent_2,What Thai restaurant in Takoma Park?,
1355,61,agent_1,"Its called Kin Da, its a good choice for healthy eaters",
1356,61,agent_2,sounds good.  I guess they sell a lot of vegetables and tofu.,
1357,61,agent_1,"Yeah tofu with broccoli and peanuts, do you like tofu?",
1358,61,agent_2,"Its ok, its a good way to eat healthy",
1359,61,agent_1,"I agree, tasty way to remain fit, do you also like movies? if you do the iPic is a great choice of venue",
1360,61,agent_2,I do like movies.  I watched the incredibles 2 recently. have you seen it?,
1361,61,agent_1,"No, ive been wanting to watch that one, is it good? the first one was awesome",
1362,61,agent_2,It is good. It's got some new characters and cast but the originals all reprise their roles.,
1363,61,agent_1,I heard that Huckleberry Milner and Bob Odenkirk are among the new members of the movie,
1364,61,agent_2,They are along with Jonathan Banks.  The movie is set in the 1960s by the way.,
1365,61,agent_1,In the 60s really? so it happened before the firs movie?is it also based in the present time?,
1366,61,agent_2,I honestly don't remember. I think both are in the 60s but don't quote me on that.,
1367,61,agent_1,"Oh ok, I guess no spoilers there then, I have to watch the movie,",
1368,62,agent_1,"Hi, DO you like music?",
1369,62,agent_2,Love music! Especially Zeppelin what about you?,
1370,62,agent_1,"Nice, I am a fan of Linkin Park and I like their album Hybrid Theory. DO you have a favorite album?",
1371,62,agent_2,I like all of Led Zeppelin's albums. I also like Metallica. Their album and justice for all is my favorite. do you ever listen to Radiohead?,
1372,62,agent_1,I do to some of the songs. Do you know who has the best selling album of 21st century,
1373,62,agent_2,No I don't. Who is it? I do know that even Bob Marley still sells a lot of albums apparently,
1374,62,agent_1,It is Hybrid Theory by Linkin Park,
1375,62,agent_2,I see. Do they sell that at Walmart? Apparently Walmart only has clean versions of albums,
1376,62,agent_1,"I am not sure, I guess they could. Do you know which one was the best selling album in 2014?",
1377,62,agent_2,I don't actually. Who was it? I'm old so I listen to a lot of audio cassettes and also vinyl from the 70s. What about you?,
1378,62,agent_1,It was The Dark Side of the Moon even though it was released 40 years ago,
1379,62,agent_2,Wow that's cool. I love Pink Floyd! What about you? My favorite album of theirs is animals,
1380,62,agent_1,"Oh nice, I am not too familiar with their music but listen to some of the songs only. In Japan there were twins that released an album at the age of 100",
1381,62,agent_2,That sounds cool actually. Did you hear about the deaf rapper? I guess he apparently will rhyme in sign language,
1382,62,agent_1,I would love to see that actually. DO you like Tupac?,
1383,62,agent_2,I've heard about him a little bit. Are there any cool facts that you can tell me? Apparently McDonald's will pay a rapper $5 when they reference the Big Mac LOL,
1384,62,agent_1,Wow that is crazy. Yeah Tupac's music was so great that it is in the library of congress now,
1385,62,agent_2,That's impressive! Did you know that the world's fastest rapper can rap at a rate of 14 syllables per second? I wonder if Tupac would be able to do that if he were still alive,
1386,62,agent_1,I do not think Tupac was able to do that and that is impressive. Have you heard of compliment battle,
1387,62,agent_2,I have. As opposed to a dissing battle. I think a compliment battle is a lot more positive! Do you ever listen to rap music in your car?,
1388,62,agent_1,From time to time if the channel I like plays it. Nice chatting with you,
1389,63,agent_1,Hello! You can call me A.,
1390,63,agent_2,"Hello A! Are you a fan of Best Buy? I feel like I hardly buy thing sat Best Buy anymore, but apparently they have a service that offers unlimited technical support for an annual fee of $199, would you pay for something like that?",
1391,63,agent_1,"Howdy! I don't mind Best Buy its always kind of fun just to browse even though I don't plan on buying anything, I think that $200 seems high, I wouldn't buy it. For some people who are not very good with technology probably well worth it.",
1392,63,agent_2,"I agree, I'm guilty of the same thing. One time, I did stumble upon some GoPro accessories at a massive discount so I purchase those from there. $200 is very expensive, it's almost enough to buy something new in the electronics department!",
1393,63,agent_1,"It doesn't seem like too much if you think of it like a monthly service, only like $16 over 12 months. Seems like something if you used it alot could really get your moneys worth.",
1394,63,agent_2,"That's a great way to look at it! It's pretty astonishing to see how Amazon's presence has led to many of Best Buy's competitors to stay afloat, like 嗨嗨 Gregg and Radio Shack, etc. I wonder what the next disruptor is",
1395,63,agent_1,"Yeah I think that Best Buy and Amazon are going to stay competitive and stay profitable, I bet a lot of people prefer the convenience of buying online, but I like to be able to see it before you buy, sometimes the hassle of making a return and be frustrating. Kind of neat that Amazon started out as simply an online bookstore, I wish I could have been an investor in those early days.",
1396,63,agent_2,"I think Best Buy's strategy of price matching is a great strategy for people willing to go in stores to view the item before purchasing. I agree, I think I'd be very wealthy had I invented money in Amazon in those early days. I wonder how much Apple pays Amazon for their 1-click buying license fees. What a great patent!",
1397,63,agent_1,"I really do like the idea of price matching too! I was able to use that once at Walmart, I used it on a computer and I think I saved close to $100 too! I'm not too familiar with their 1-click buying, is that like buying things from your phone without a checkout? I can get that with my phone provider, the content I purchase online can be billed straight to my phone bill, which is nice... but very easy to spend money that I should probably be saving!",
1398,63,agent_2,"Oh wow! I haven't tried it but I see customers at Target use it. Do they give you a hard time for the price match process? I actually hate the one-click option because it uses your default card and at the push of a button, you purchase it and it sends it to your default address. Makes for purchasing products in a jiffy super streamlined.",
1399,63,agent_1,"The price match at Walmart was very easy, I just searched for the product and found a lower price, and the cashier used that at the register! easy! I think they recently changed that policy though because somehow people were abusing it through fake stores.",
1400,63,agent_2,"Oh wow! They don't even need a manger's approval to do it? I totally need to try that some time since if I search and it comes out cheaper, I just buy it online at home and put it back on to the shelf! I hate people who abuse the niceness of these things, makes it for innocent people like me unable to take advantage.",
1401,63,agent_1,"I think they did need a manager for the approval, it was kind of a process... but was really worth it, I would easily do it again no problem. I think I saved close to $100 I could have easily waited in line for just as long, even if there was a difficult process I would do it. I think though that as long as Walmart, or Best Buy is getting people in the doors and making purchases they are happy to match prices!",
1402,63,agent_2,"That's great to hear! Thanks for sharing your insights! I can't believe new google employees are called 'nooglers' and given a propeller beanie cap to wear, it seems like some sort of office hazing.",
1403,63,agent_1,"Ahh that just sounds like good fun! From what I hear working at google would be an awesome job! Great benefits and good pay! Would be awesome to work there. I think they are based out in California? I am based closer to the Pacific Northwest my self, might be similar to work at Amazon one day... working towards a degree in IT... Who knows? I can dream right?",
1404,63,agent_2,"Oh wow! That's awesome, I was recently in Seattle and was amazed by the shiny offices of the Amazon headquarters and the Amazon Go store, both seem like great and prestigious places to work out, well I wish you good luck in your endeavors!",
1405,63,agent_1,"Yeah I was in downtown Seattle recently too! The traffic by the new Amazon Go store was awful, we were stuck at the same light for like 10 minutes! We didn't get a chance to see the Amazon Go store, its a cool idea, that's the one with no cash registers right? Just walk out right? I think I really like that idea! sometimes waiting in line is just the worst",
1406,63,agent_2,"Traffic is terrible and the cold and rain makes it especially worse. Yes, that's the cashless or no-employee store. I did try it out and it is pretty cool, but the store was a lot smaller than what I imagined. It's similar to a gas station convenience store, I think most people go for the pre-packed foods during lunch/dinner hours.",
1407,63,agent_1,"Some of the new technology headed down the pipeline seems really cool, I wonder what will be next? I really like the idea of a smart home, stuff like Alexa. Sometimes that kind of tech is getting creepy, like you dont know if its listening? I think most companies are ethical and dont listen because they dont have to, looking to make a profit. Kind of creepy and neat that Google uses android phone locations to track traffic",
1408,63,agent_2,"I wish eventually my home can be ""smart home"". I do find it super convenient to control my home lights with my voice especially when I'm tucked into bed and too lazy to get up to close the lights. Yes, I also have those curiosities and also the webcam feature on my electronic devices. Amazon's logo points an arrow from everything A to Z so it's difficult to figure out just where they are headed, I'm guessing cars?",
1409,63,agent_1,"The only smart devices I have is a smart outlet, control it with an app. Its really kind of neat, is nice to be able to turn the lights on before I get into the house, especially if I am carrying something and can't hit the light switch. its got a security feature too that will have the lights on and turn off automatically when you are on vacation, makes it look like people are home. Somebody will do self driving cars soon, I wouldn't doubt it.",
1410,64,agent_1,Good morning!,
1411,64,agent_2,"Good morning, are you a big fan of going to the movies?",
1412,64,agent_1,I love it! How bout yourself?,
1413,64,agent_2,I haven't enjoyed it as much lately! I find that there are too many distractions and it bothers me.,
1414,64,agent_1,Thats true. Do you use Movie pass to go?,
1415,64,agent_2,No but I have a friend who did. He lives right by a movie theater and he would go about 3 times a week. He got a lot of value from his membership.,
1416,64,agent_1,wow! That would be so much fun to live by a theater! Ours doesn't take movie pass. I think they have saved a lot of theaters though.,
1417,64,agent_2,I read that the company is not doing so well. They offered a lot of passes at a deep discount and now theaters are not letting them be used as frequently.,
1418,64,agent_1,Oh no! thats not really fair. I use Amazon a lot at home to watch movies. How bout you?,
1419,64,agent_2,I use Netflix mostly but have started to use Amazon a lot more.,
1420,64,agent_1,Did you know Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10000 years?,
1421,64,agent_2,"I did not know that, I wonder what the reasoning was behind that?",
1422,64,agent_1,He's the richest man ever maybe? I have no clue!,
1423,64,agent_2,"Haha, I hope it had some scientific purpose besides him having way too much money. Do you watch any of the shows on Amazon Prime?",
1424,64,agent_1,Mostly movies that I cant find on Netflix! What about you?,
1425,64,agent_2,I watched a couple HBO shows through Prime. I have been watching more Netflix programming lately because they have had some interesting documentaries.,
1426,64,agent_1,They really do. I bet blockbuster is kicking itself now for not buying them!,
1427,64,agent_2,I wonder if they would have let Netflix grow into the company that they are now. I don't know if Blockbuster would have encouraged the streaming and original programming over DVD rentals.,
1428,64,agent_1,I bet you are right. What documentary would you recommend on Netflix?,
1429,64,agent_2,"I recently watched the series about Ted Bundy, I was not alive for that story and it was very interesting to see the court proceedings and just how crazy he was. I would definitely recommend that.",
1430,64,agent_1,"I'll have to look it up. I watch youtube too, how about you?",
1431,64,agent_2,Sometimes i do to learn about things I want to do around the house or for movie trailers.,
1432,64,agent_1,I was watching what is coming out on Netflix this month on youtube yesterday!,
1433,64,agent_2,"I hope you enjoy the Bundy documentary, it was nice chatting with you!",
1434,65,agent_1,Hi Do you like music?,
1435,65,agent_2,I do! I am listening to it now. Do you like music?,
1436,65,agent_1,I love music. I was happy to learn that linking park's Hybrid theory is the best selling album of this century!,
1437,65,agent_2,"That's weird. Of all the albums to be the best selling, Hybrid Theory? Huh...",
1438,65,agent_1,"I really like it, But do you know which was one of the best selling albums in 2014?",
1439,65,agent_2,"I do not, which one?",
1440,65,agent_1,Pink floyd's Dark side of the moon!,
1441,65,agent_2,Wow. I am listening to Division Bell right now. Seems like weird timing. What happened in 2014?,
1442,65,agent_1,Well it is interesting that an album that is so old sells so well in this decade,
1443,65,agent_2,Yeah. I wonder if there was an event that made it more popular? Like a movie coming out. Have you heard of NWA?,
1444,65,agent_1,"No, tell me about it!",
1445,65,agent_2,They were the first album to reach platinum without a major tour or airplay. Seems like a grassroots album.,
1446,65,agent_1,"That is neat! Do you like to watch comedy? I did like the show 3rd rock from the sun, did you watch it?",
1447,65,agent_2,"I do, and yes, I loved 3rd rock. I found it funny but the older son was pretty annoying, French Stewart, I think was his name?",
1448,65,agent_1,"They were all crazy, I used to watch it on Friday nights. J Gordon Levitt was so small. They did beat Seinfield, Friends and Frasier!",
1449,65,agent_2,Those were all big hits! I am surprised it did so well.,
1450,65,agent_1,I agree I enjoyed them all. I enjoy comedy in general. I love old silent movies that achieved great comedy with no sound!,
1451,65,agent_2,"I love the 3 stooges. Although they have sound, I love pysical comedy of it.",
1452,65,agent_1,They are incredible! The are part  of what is called slapstick comedies!,
1453,65,agent_2,I love those. I remember staying home on friday nights until they were over. I would have a whiskey and watch. My roommates would make fun of me until they started watching with me...,
1454,65,agent_1,that sounds like a great plan. Well it was great chatting with you. Have a great day!,
1455,66,agent_1,Hi do you listen to the radio still?,
1456,66,agent_2,"Hello, I actually do. I'm close enough to the border of Canada, and was surprised to find out that Canadian law requires 40% of all music played to be Canadian. Are there even that many Canadian artists?",
1457,66,agent_1,Nice!  There's a ton of great Canadian artists!  Especially rock and hard rock.  Jupiter has radio storms that can be picked up and heard on AM radio.  That's neat!,
1458,66,agent_2,"I would love to hear that, along with the news program that is entirely in Latin.",
1459,66,agent_1,"I've read about that station.  They've broadcasted that weekly since 1989, which is the year I graduated high school ironically. lol",
1460,66,agent_2,lol. Amazing how that works. I'm trying to find the site that has the radio dramas available for free.,
1461,66,agent_1,Nice.  That would really tickle my ears to hear those!  Soldiers in WW2 made simple radios by using a razorblade and a pencil as the diode.  They were called foxhole radios.,
1462,66,agent_2,"My grandfather actually taught me how to make one. He told me it would help with trying to contact aliens, lol. To be honest, I think he was talking about country music, as he wasn't a fan...I do think he would have liked U2's version of country though.",
1463,66,agent_1,That's awesome!  I don't mind some of the country music...more the old style traditional country.  The new country music just sounds like pop music to me.  There are only 2 African Americans in the country music hall of fame.,
1464,66,agent_2,"That needs to be remedied, as there are so many great country artists. I wonder if George Strait gets a discount at Amazon, since he and Bezos are cousins?",
1465,66,agent_1,What are the odds of that?  Henry Ford wasn't a country fan.,
1466,66,agent_2,"He wasn't a jazz fan either, lol",
1467,66,agent_1,No he wasn't lol,
1468,66,agent_2,Do you know where to find the site to participate in Unicef's clean water program?,
1469,66,agent_1,I don't but wish I could because I would love to give a child a day of clean water in exchange for every minute I'm not on my cell phone.,
1470,66,agent_2,"I would too. It's amazing that the iphone has more computing power than the nuclear icbm deterrent. Well, that is frightening, anyway.",
1471,66,agent_1,That's a lot of power in our pockets. lol  Do you still use phone books?  It's impossible to seperate 2 phonebooks that simply have their pages overlapped together.  I don't use them anymore but they keep dropping them off all the time.,
1472,66,agent_2,"I do not, yet I still get them too. It seems fitting that New York's area code is 212, as it's the fastest to dial. New Yorkers are always in a hurry.",
1473,66,agent_1,Yes they are!  lol  The cables carrying phone and internet data across the oceans are only 2.7 inches in diameter and just lay on the ocean floor.  Someday a lobster is going to be the cause of the next big internet and phone outage.,
1474,66,agent_2,"I wouldnt doubt it. They are probably studying the cables, and trying to mimic the electronic signals...to confuse the chefs on the proper way to prepare lobster, lol.",
1475,66,agent_1,LOL It's been fun!  Nice chatting!  Have a great day!,
1476,67,agent_1,"Hi, how are you? Are you from DC?",
1477,67,agent_2,I am not. I did hear that Bloomingdale's is hosting a Superbowl party there.,
1478,67,agent_1,Really? That's interesting. Do you know which one?,
1479,67,agent_2,I hear it is Bloomingdale's Boundary Stone but I'm not familiar with that venue. Dodge City is also hosting a Puppy Bowl party.,
1480,67,agent_1,I think I would rather see Rose McGowan than go to Bloomingdales. What a weird event for them to use as a special event. What about the oscars instead for them.,
1481,67,agent_2,I would imagine they have a party for that as well. I wouldn't want to go to a huge Superbowl party like that either. Too loud. Do you enjoy comedy films by any chance?,
1482,67,agent_1,"Yes, I do like comedies. Step Brothers is one of my favorites.",
1483,67,agent_2,I love Step Brothers. I also really like Monty Python. Graham Chapman was a doctor before going into comedy. He certainly had a lucrative fallback if that didn't work out.,
1484,67,agent_1,YEAH! I am really embarrassed to say this but I have never seen monty python. I feel like I missed my window to see it too.,
1485,67,agent_2,"Watch the movies first. They are more accessible than the show I think. Try Holy Grail, Life of Brian, and the Meaning of Life. Python programming language is even named after them. They are so iconic.",
1486,67,agent_1,I will try to watch Holy Grail today. I just saw it on Hulu yesterday and thought about watching it then.,
1487,67,agent_2,It is very quotable. It can also be very silly. I can't believe that Evan Almighty is the most expensive comedy ever made. That shocks me.,
1488,67,agent_1,Yeah. Maybe the CGI was a lot of money. Most comedies don't use CGI so that may be an explanation. I wonder how much Kung Fu Hustle was to make...,
1489,67,agent_2,It certainly looks like it would have cost quite a bit. I enjoy a lot of Comedy Central shows but they cancel a lot of them that they try out. They've cancelled over 100 since their inception.,
1490,67,agent_1,I do not watch a ton of Comedy Central. I am not sure why but I just got away from that channel. Do you enjoy their shows?,
1491,67,agent_2,"I do. I like The Daily Show, South Park, Drunk History. There are a lot I like. Do you like SNL?",
1492,67,agent_1,I usually just watch teh SNL highlights.How is the daily show with trevor noah? I really like him but do not stay up that late to watch.,
1493,67,agent_2,"It's very good. The skits are lacking because I think they need better talent outside of him but his monologue is always great. On SNL, Weekend Update was on on the very first episode and is their longest running skit. That's a long run.",
1494,67,agent_1,That is a long run! I would like to watch the Daily Show more but just have too much in my life to watch right now. Maybe I can watch it on the train or something...,
1495,67,agent_2,I watch it on the Comedy Central app later the next day. I used to watch The Simpsons but have not in a long time. Did you know that in the first 400 episodes Homer had 188 different jobs?,
1496,67,agent_1,That many? I love the simpsons and would have never guessed that many. Wow.,
1497,67,agent_2,Yes and I wonder how many since then.,
1498,68,agent_1,"Hi there, do you have a pet?",
1499,68,agent_2,"Hi there, I have a dog and a cat and you?",
1500,68,agent_1,I have a dog only. DO you know what the first cloned cat was named?,
1501,68,agent_2,"Oh yeah the copy cat, that is the most fitting name to be honest",
1502,68,agent_1,That sure is. There are more tiger pets in the us than there are in asia in the wild,
1503,68,agent_2,"That makes me really sad, they are supposed to be in the wild",
1504,68,agent_1,Yes agreed. Roosevelt has 20 pets and among the a hyena and a bear,
1505,68,agent_2,Wow good for him. In Japan there are more pets than kids under 15,
1506,68,agent_1,Wow that is crazy. In Colorado you are the guardian and not the owner of the pet,
1507,68,agent_2,"I like that we should adopt it for the other states as well, all across",
1508,68,agent_1,I agree with that. Do you use your phone much?,
1509,68,agent_2,All the time actually. DO you know why the area code of NY is 212?,
1510,68,agent_1,I think it is because it was easy to dial it on a rotary phone right?,
1511,68,agent_2,Yes that was it Did you ever use a phone book as well?,
1512,68,agent_1,Nope I did not but I heard if two of them get stuck it is impossible to separate them,
1513,68,agent_2,Nice one. UNICEF donates water when we do not use the phone.,
1514,68,agent_1,"Wow I wonder how that works, maybe we should then all use it less and less",
1515,68,agent_2,I think so too. Do you like cats?,
1516,68,agent_1,"I do actually, there are cat cafes in Japan, sounds pretty cool",
1517,68,agent_2,Yeah it sure does. When cats reach 15 years of age they have slept for 10 years out of that,
1518,68,agent_1,I think that is definitely what they do best.,
1519,69,agent_1,"Hello, do you watch YouTube?",
1520,69,agent_2,I do! how bout yourself?,
1521,69,agent_1,I love YouTube. I pretty much watch it everyday. Did you know it is the second largest search engine on the net?,
1522,69,agent_2,I did not know that! I was watching last night and someone named Pewdiepie was on. Something about fighting with his brother!,
1523,69,agent_1,LOL that's funny. Justin Bieber's baby song is the most disliked video on YouTube.,
1524,69,agent_2,Baby song? What is that about?,
1525,69,agent_1,I have no idea lol. Did you know Netflix and YouTube make up half of the peak internet usage in North America?,
1526,69,agent_2,I have read that. Do you watch Netflix? It's a great platform.,
1527,69,agent_1,I love Netflix. I have an account through T Mobile. What about you?,
1528,69,agent_2,I love it too. I'm one of the original cord cutters and they are the reason why! I usually just watch it thru my internet.,
1529,69,agent_1,That's awesome. Police actually have their down YouTube called BlueTube which is a way to share law enforcement videos.,
1530,69,agent_2,I will have to look that up! I wonder if a private citizen can watch it?,
1531,69,agent_1,I highly doubt they can. The Gangnam Style song got so many views on YouTube that they had to upgrade the view count to 64-bits....LOL>,
1532,69,agent_2,Oh wow! That is so awesome to know! I once read that constant clicking of the internet buttons can cause addiction.,
1533,69,agent_1,I bet it can. Did you know the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button?,
1534,69,agent_2,I had no idea. How fun! Did you read that Pixar has a secret room for celebs? How odd!,
1535,69,agent_1,That's really cool. I love Pixar. They make such high quality movies.,
1536,69,agent_2,I think so too. Did you ever watch Sesame street?,
1537,69,agent_1,I used to watch it back when I was little. What about you?,
1538,69,agent_2,i did. Seems funny to see Carol Burnett on it. She was one of the first celebs to be on sesame street.,
1539,69,agent_1,That's awesome. It was good talking with you!,
